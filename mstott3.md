# A Web-Hosted Stock Trading Bot

## Summary
Many people are looking to invest there money, but aren't able or willing to take the substantial amount of time it takes to learn the ins-and-outs and best practices of the process, and even fewer are willing to put their hard-earned money in the trust of a professional broker. BrokerBot (tentative title) seeks to alleviate this worry by allowing average joes like myself to intrust their investing to a logical, well trained AI who can dedicate all of its time to monitoring the ups and downs of the market and capitalizing on dips and spikes in the moment to moment changes therein. While stock bot services are nothing new, BrokerBot will be unique in that it is available for a low cost and will not eat away at the user's profits by taking a commision; rather, the service will be offered via a subscription.

## The Problem Being Solved
The desire of most people is to generate passive income, and BrokerBot can offer that for a low price. By bypassing the relatively high entry barrier for stock trading yourself, BrokerBot will be able to make informed decisions based on the history and contemporary trends of the market.

## Features
* Web client for monitoring your investments and managing your available funds
* A "hotlist" of particular stocks you would like the bot to prefer
* An option to locally host instances of BrokerBot for users who wish to do so
* Direct transfer from your BrokerBot funds to your bank account and vice versa

## Languages/Frameworks
* The code for the trading bot itself will mostly be written in python and perhaps some c++ for optimization.
* Web development is not my forte, but I would expect to use C#, .NET, and JavaScript to implement the monitoring software and other web features. As far as the existing frameworks available, I will leave that to my more experienced team members to choose.
