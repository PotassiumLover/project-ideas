# Project Idea/Summary


My project idea is an online food ordering and food delivery platform such as GrubHub and DoorDash, but not as complex as these giants. This app allows users to specify their preferences on what they would like to eat, and then the app will get meal options from curated restaurants and fast food places.


# Problem to Solve

This app solves the problem of helping users find restuarants and fast food places within minutes, given all the user preferences. Sometimes people have a hard time choosing what and where they want to eat, and this app is very efficient in solving this problem.


# Features

* User enters full address

* Interface displaying nearby fast food places and restaurants

* Time it will take to deliver food from each place

* Filters that users can choose from to narrow down on preferred choices

# Technology

* Frontend: JavaScript
* Backend: C++/Java, Node.js


# Customer

This application is catered to almost everyone, especially for those who want to find nearby options quick and want their food to delivered to them.
