---
## Problem
Chess is a difficult game to learn when you have never played before. This software will be designed with beginners in mind to have an easy place to learn and practice chess.  
This project would be to create a working web-based version of chess with a built in opponent of variable difficulty. This should also include the ability to turn off the bot and play in a two player mode. The main purpose for this software is to create an easy way for someone to play and practice chess.

##Major Features:
- Fully playable game of chess with GUI. This would include sprites for the pieces and an interface for the game.

- Built in opponent that will play against the user.

- Different difficulty modes for built in opponent(based on how many moves ahead the program calculates)

- Two player mode to play against another person.

---
##Languages and Tools:
- Webpage and game would be written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

- The built in opponent would be written in C++ or Javascript.

---
##Audience
This software is intended for anyone who wants to play chess either against a bot or another person. It will primarily focus on beginners to chess as it will provide a platform to learn against the built in opponents and eventually beat them and move up to the next difficulty level.
