# Summary
A tool to help instructors teach Data Structures & Algorithms through interactive visualizations of these data structures and algorithms.
# Problem
Learning the fundamentals of computer science is hard. It can be even harder if the instructor doesn't prepare proper visualizations to help students grasp the many concepts.

## Features
- MVP
  - Provide an interface for creating visualizations of any data structure and their associated algorithms
  - Create a viewport for interacting with the data structures and algorithms
  - Implement the following simple data structures: linked list, binary trees, and graphs.
  - Implement basic algorithms on the simple data structures: traversing a linked list, binary search on binary trees, and depth-first search on graphs

- Stretch
  - Implement more advanced algorithms on the simple data structures: reversing linked list, network flow for graphs, etc.
  - Implement more advanced data structures: AVL trees, heaps, tries, disjoint set
  - URL specifying the data structure and algorithm used, so that students can easily access the instructors visualization

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript
- Canvas API

## Target
This app will be made with both students and instructors in mind. It should be easy to set up so that instructors don't feel the barrier to entry is too high for use, and intuitive so that students can easily use the app for learning.
