# Personal Project Tracker

### Summary: 
The Personal Project Tracker  would allow a user to input and manage tasks all from the ease of a webpage. 

### Problem:
Sometimes its hard to keep track of tasks you have to do in your day to day lives and organize your productivity based on importance so you get the stuff you want to get done before the menial, unimportant tasks. Sometimes the tasks are too large and complex to reasonably keep track of without writing it down. This application would solve a variety of problems in prioritizing, reminding, and managing one's time.

### Features:

* Multiple files of trees if you want to keep track of multiple projects
* Change between two views: A. a visible tree on the screen and B. a complete list view.

### Technology:
*	Javascript
*	css
*	html

### Audience:
* Anyone who has a large amount of tasks/someone who has a hard time managing what they want to get done like a student.

* Someone in a job trying to manage multiple projects or one very large project.
