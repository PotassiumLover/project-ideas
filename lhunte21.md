## Summary 
The main idea of this project is to be able to track workouts, nutrition,  and other aspects of fitness more effectively.  The app would be an ios app make it easy to track your progress overtime so you are more effecient at progressing through your fitness journey.  

## The Problem Being Solved
Many people who workout do not track their progress and it really hurts their potential gains.  I feel a big reason people do not track themselves is because it's not very convienent.  An easy to use app on one's phone would solve this problem.

## Major Features
The app would feature a log of all your previous workout sessions and allow you to create new ones.  The app would reccomend and create workouts for you based on your previous activities.  There will be embeded videos of how to do workouts in case someone does not know how to do something.  If there is enough time I think it would also be cool to be able to conncect with friends on the app and check out each others progress.

## Languages to be Used
Since we will be dealing with IOS development, the main language we will be using is swift.  Starting out all files will be stored locally but as we progress we might choose to keep data in a database.

## Who Would Use It
The main audience would be people who workout or who are interested in starting their fitness journey.
