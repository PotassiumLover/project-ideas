# Inventory Management System
The idea is to create an application that allows small businesses to manage their inventory. The business owner would be able to add inventory and remove inventory and have it connect to some store front for automatic updating. Additionally, the business owner would be able to track all sorts of metrics such as highest grossing product, total sales, products that are near expiration, and max storage capacity for each item so that they do not over order. 
# Problem Being Solved
The problem being solved is the accessibility and affordability of this sort of software. This product is specifically designed for smaller businesses. 
# Features
- Add and remove inventory
- see highest grossing products
- track inventory life span  
- keep track of total sales
# Languages / Tool Set
- C++
- Qt 
- MySQL (possibly)
# Who Would Buy This
The people who would buy this would be small businesses that cant afford such advanced sort of systems but still want to be able to keep track of all their records digitally.
