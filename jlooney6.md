## Project idea: n-dimensional Minesweeper

We've all played and enjoyed wasting time on the classic computer game, Minesweeper. But come on: two dimensions? How boring! 
Since the setup and rules for minesweeper are so simple, they could easily be applied to higher dimensions for a more challenging puzzle.

## What is being solved

This project aims to take everything great about minesweeper but make it more challenging. Minesweeper's core rules are simple and easy to pick up on, making it a great office time waster. However, after you learn all the ways to deduce where mines are, the game's challenge wears off. If however, there was a whole other dimension where mines could be, players would 
have to devise new ways of solving the puzzle. This will hopefully create a more rewarding challenge for players.

## Features

The game will use a 3D environment to display the mines. Then, for dimensions higher than 3, sliders/some other control method can be added to "shift" into a new cube.
The goal would be to get at least to the 5th dimension, and then add more/new ways of play after.

## Languages and tools

This project could be accomplished with any framework/engine for displaying 3D graphics. Some that come to mind that I've used before are Panda3D for Python or Unity for C#. 
Anything that can easily display boxes in 3D will work.

## Who would buy this?

Honestly, no one would ever buy this on its own. However, it could be a game shipped with other software like an OS, just like original minesweeper. Then, the game would be played by people looking for a challenging puzzle game they can play in the background.
