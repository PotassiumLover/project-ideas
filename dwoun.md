## Brief summary of the project idea
The project idea is to help students access accurate information of the UT bus system. The current software from the Tennessee app is error prone. The map often does not show the buses enroute, and the application often presents inaccurate arrival times. The project goal is to present a more accurate location of the UT bus and provide a reasonable arrival time at each stop. Additionally, the user interface needs to be changed to be more user friendly.

## What problem is being solved
When students often check the Tennessee app for the bus location and arrival time, the map location and arrival time are often inaccurate or not existent. With an overhaul of the software, students can easily access accurate information about the bus system.

## List of some of the major features
- Present the GPS map location of the bus
- Present the arriavl time of the bus at each stop
- Provide thorough information about various bus routes and the time of their operation
- Potentially add a way to call a T-Link 

## Languages and Toolsets
- Python
- MongoDB
- Android Studio

## Who would buy/use this solution
UT students, staff, and professors who utilize the bus.
